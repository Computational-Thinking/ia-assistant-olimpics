# Branch chat-gpt-4-allocation-problem

Here is a new formulation to chat-gpt-4 as a resource allocation problem.


## Formulating the question

### Q 

How can I solve the resource allocation problem in a graph? Assume I have a graph of nodes and edges and I have to allocate resources (say hospitals for instance) in a subset of the nodes in order guarantee that any node is served from a resource not far than 1 edge.

### A

The problem you are describing is called the **minimum dominating set problem**¹. It is a well-known problem in graph theory that has many applications in computer science, operations research, and other fields.

The minimum dominating set problem is defined as follows: given an undirected graph G = (V, E), find a minimum subset D of V such that every vertex not in D is adjacent to at least one vertex in D ¹. In your case, you want to find a minimum subset of nodes such that every node in the graph is within one edge of a node in the subset.

This problem is NP-hard ¹, which means that there is no known algorithm that can solve it efficiently for all instances of the problem. However, there are many approximation algorithms that can provide good solutions in practice ².

One such algorithm is called the **greedy algorithm** ². The greedy algorithm starts with an empty set and iteratively adds nodes to the set until every node in the graph is within one edge of a node in the set. At each iteration, it adds the node that covers the most uncovered nodes.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.

### Q

Can you write a JavaScript solution?

### A 

Sure! Here's a JavaScript solution that uses the greedy algorithm I mentioned earlier:

```javascript
function minimumDominatingSet(graph) {
  const nodes = Object.keys(graph);
  const dominatingSet = new Set();

  while (nodes.length > 0) {
    let bestNode = null;
    let bestCount = -1;

    for (const node of nodes) {
      const neighbors = graph[node];
      const uncoveredNeighbors = neighbors.filter(n => !dominatingSet.has(n));

      if (uncoveredNeighbors.length > bestCount) {
        bestNode = node;
        bestCount = uncoveredNeighbors.length;
      }
    }

    dominatingSet.add(bestNode);
    nodes.splice(nodes.indexOf(bestNode), 1);
  }

  return dominatingSet;
}
```

The `graph` parameter is an object that maps each node to an array of its neighbors. For example, if you have a graph with nodes `A`, `B`, and `C`, where `A` is connected to `B` and `C`, you would represent it like this:

```javascript
{
  A: ['B', 'C'],
  B: ['A'],
  C: ['A']
}
```

The function returns a set of nodes that form a minimum dominating set.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.

## Conclusion

There were several errors in the  solution proposed by Chat-gpt-4.

I had to change `nodes` from an array to a Set for convenience.

The main error is that covered/dominated elements weren't supressed.

```js
    // Added by human. Missed this line
    for (const neighbor of graph[bestNode]) {
      //console.log(`Removing node ${neighbor} from the graph`);
      nodes.delete(String(neighbor));
    }
```

Here are some executions:
