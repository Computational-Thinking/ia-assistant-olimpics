 An archipelago is made up of N islands,  some of which are connected by P bidirectional bridges.

 It is known that there is at most one bridge between each pair of islands.
 They want to build hospitals so that no one has to cross more than one bridge to get to a hospital.

 The problem is: What is the minimum number of hospitals needed?

 Write a function that, given the number of islands N, the number of bridges P, and the connections array between the islands,
 returns the minimum number of hospitals needed.

 The connections array  consist of an array of P  pairs [x, y], with x not equal to y, containing the islands connected by each bridge. 

 Assume N is greater than 1 and less or equal to 105, 

 Assumen P is between 0 and N, 

 Assume that the islands are natural numbers numbered from 0, and 

 Assume that there is no more than one bridge between two islands.
